# Welcome to the XKE-NG project.

This project is a study on the use of Android and REST services from a more
architectural point of view. It is also meant to gain knowledge about the use
of the Android API and REST services in an enterprise way.

Basically it consists of the following components:

* Android front-end to browse through conference talks
* REST services to manage talks

There are five projects:

  1. XCoSS (Xebia Conference Scheduling System - Java)
  2. aXCV (Xebia Conference Viewer for Android)
  3. iXCV (Xebia Conference Viewer for iPhone/iPad)
  4. xke-ng-web (Xebia Conference Scheduling System - Scala)
  5. MockServer (Mocks the xke-ng-web)

The projects are explained below:

* XCoSS 
is the server component with a web interface and REST services,
based on XML and/or JSON, written in Java and using Hibernate.

* aXCV
is the Android 2+ client for viewing and editing conference sessions.

* iXCV  
is currently not active, but will do the same as aXCV.

* xke-ng-web 
is the server component with a web interface and REST services,
based on JSON, written in Scala and using ???.

* MockServer 
is a Play framework application. Download play at playframework.org
and start with 'play run MockServer' in this directory.
After the MockServer has started request a page: http://localhost:9000/conferences/2011
